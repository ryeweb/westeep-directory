# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Configuration

## Project Context
- WeStep directory project built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase
- Deployed via Vercel
- Source code on GitHub (currently public repo)
- I'm a beginner learning web development

## Development Tools & Stack
- Supabase: Database and authentication
- GitHub: Version control
- Vercel: Hosting and deployment
- Claude Code: AI development assistant

## Core Working Principles
1. ALWAYS create a plan before making any changes
2. After planning, provide a short plain-language summary of what you'll do
3. Flag any potential issues, risks, or concerns you foresee
4. Explain technical concepts in beginner-friendly terms
5. Document as you build (see Documentation section below)

## Feature Development Process (Vertical Slicing)
1. **Plan the vertical slice:** Define feature end-to-end, break into increments
2. **Implement incrementally:** Start simple, test each step, add complexity gradually
3. **Document continuously:** Update PROJECT.md with what was built and why
4. **Review:** Provide plain-language summary and flag any technical debt

## Documentation & Knowledge Management
- Maintain PROJECT.md tracking:
  - Features implemented and how they work
  - Database schema and changes
  - API endpoints and their purpose
  - Known issues and todos
  - Important "why" decisions
- Update CHANGELOG.md for significant changes
- Document new environment variables as they're added

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript with clear type definitions
- Keep code simple and readable (I'm learning!)
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Add explanatory comments for complex logic

## Git & Version Control
- Create descriptive commit messages
- Test changes before committing
- Ask before major architectural changes

## Security
- Never commit API keys, passwords, or secrets
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Verify .gitignore includes .env files

## When Making Changes
1. State what you're about to do and why
2. Create a clear plan with steps
3. Summarize the plan in simple terms
4. Call out any risks or things to watch for
5. Execute after I approve
6. Update documentation when complete
